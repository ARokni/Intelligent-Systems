# First Project
 
* The project focused mainly on the **`Optimization`**.

* **Problem 1**:  Implementing **`Newton`** algorithm with **`Backtracking Line Search`** to find the minimum of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(x) = -(10x^3%2B60x - 2x^6  - 3x^4 - 12x^2)">.

* **Problem 2**: Implementing **`Stochastic Gradient Descent`** algorithm for optimizing  **`SVM`** loss (**`L2-Regularized SVM`**) on **`MNIST`** dataset.

* **Problem 3**: Implementing **`Genetic Algorithm`** in order to solve the **`Graph Coloring Problem`**(a graph with a desired shape)with minimum number of colors.
