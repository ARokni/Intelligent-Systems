# First Project
 
* The project focused mainly on the **`Optimization`**:

    -   Implementing **`Newton`** algorithm with **`Backtracking Line Search`** to find the minimum of **f(x) = -(10x^3 + 60x - 2x^6  - 3x^4 - 12x^2)**.

    - Implementing **`Stochastic Gradient Descent`** algorithm for optimizing  **`SVM`** loss (**`L2-Regularized SVM`**) on **`MNIST`** dataset.

    - Implementing **`Genetic Algorithm`** in order to solve the **`Graph Coloring`**(a graph with a desired shape) Problem(with minimum number of colors).
