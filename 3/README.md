# Third Project


 In this project I have implemented a **`Neural-Network with One Hidden Layer`**  from scratch and a **`Naive Bayes`** algorithm utilizng **`MATLAB`**.

# Neural-Network

 * The **first problem** of this project is mainly focused on **`Classification of Mnist Dataset`** utilizing a **Neural Net with One Hidden Layer**.

 * I employed a **`Gradient Descent`**, **`Stochastic Gradient Descen`** algorithm as an **optimizer** for the net. Morover, I investigated the effect of **`Momentum`** on the **optimizers**.

## Codes

The codes of the **first problem** are provided in [NeuralNet_Gradient_Descent]() and [NeuralNet_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent]().

# Naive-Bayes

* In this problem I implemented a **`Naive-Bayes`** algorithm in order to **classify** healthy and unhealthy people.

## Codes

The codes of this part are provided in [Naive-Bayes]().
