 ## Projects



 


:one: Implementing **`Newton`** algorithm with **`Backtracking Line Search`** to find the minimum of a particular function, **`Stochastic Gradient Descent`** algorithm for optimizing  **`SVM`** loss (**`L2-Regularized SVM`**) on **`MNIST`** dataset, and **`Genetic Algorithm`** in order to solve the **`Graph Coloring Problem`**(a graph with a desired shape)with minimum number of colors utilizing **`MATLAB`**.

 :two: Implementing  **`Decision Tree`** (**`ID3`** algorithm), **`Random Forest`**, **`KNN`**, and **`K-Means Clustring`** utilizing **`MATLAB`**.

:three: Implementing **`Neural Network with One Hidden Layer`** and **`Naive Bayes`** algorithm.

:four: Implementing **`Reinforcement Learning`** (**`Q-Learning`**) algorithm to solve the [**`Tower of Hanoi Problem`**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) utilizng **`MATLAB`**.
